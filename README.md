![Preview-Screens](https://github.com/steniowagner/mindCast/blob/master/PUXA-R10!.png)

If you want to take a look on all screens of the App, they are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rXFlogxaT5E0pthrrLhF1D_wOVbSHwhD).

## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

_"Share knowledge in the form of podcasts, providing a simple way to learn"._

**PS:** Podcasts was just the context chosen by me for this project, but all the code inside this app can be reused for any app that has audio-streaming as domain, so you can reuse everything here in your next music-player, podcast-library or anything inside this context!
